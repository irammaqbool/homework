	<h1>The Rain</h1>
	<h2> Summary</h2>
                   <p>In this poem, the poet describes the beautiful scene of falling rain. <br>
	The rain is falling on everything. The falling of rain creates a beautiful <br>
	symphony which is like sweet music. The whole atmosphere looks fresh <br>
	and charming. The leaves on top of trees drink  water first and then pass it <br>
	down to the lower leaves which quench their thirst afterwards. These lines <br>
	also offer a metaphor. The upper leaves of trees symbolize rich people who<br>
	 get every opportunity to make progress and mint money. The lower <br>
	leaves of trees symbolize poor people who are at the receiving end. <br>
	They do not get equal opportunities to make progress. 	As a result, <br>
	they suffer from poverty and backwardness. In the end, the poet hopes<br>
	 that the sun will shine after the rain and it will be a lovely sight.</p>
